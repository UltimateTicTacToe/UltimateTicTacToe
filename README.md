Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a twist on the classic game where you play 9 games at the same time. 
The twist is that where you go determines where your opponent is allowed to go. This creates
some fun and interesting strategy of having to plan out your moves in advance and try to 
determine your opponents strategy.

In the future, I would like to add online play with a friend. But that will be when I get more time.

UltimateTicTacToe.github.io to play the game!

Enjoy!
